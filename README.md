**Q_table_mountain_car** : an attempt to solve the MountainCar-v0 environment using Q-table . 

**continous_action_trial**: this is a q-table for continous action space for the gym enviroment (continousMountainCar-v0). I have included q-table for mountain car and cartpole so you can see the changes i made overtime  to achieve this . 

**game_cartpole_random_weights**: this was an attempt to solve the CartPole-v0 environment using random weights generated . 

**cartpole_qtable**: solving the CartPole-v0 environment using Q-table 

**highway_env_2** : solving the highway-v0 environment. Our job is to navigate our car through traffic by changing lanes and modulating its speed. I have used DQN(Deep Q network) for the same.

**highway_run** : for rendering the pretrained model . A video has been added of ai controlling the car. (highway_run.mp4)
