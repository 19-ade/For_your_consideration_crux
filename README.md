# For_your_consideration_crux
This was an attempt to make a home-made chatbot for telegram . 
chatbot.py: this is the chatbot i made. I tried making the nueral network and everything on my own , and i did , however the problem was it took too much time to process and took a couple minutes to return hi to hello. It became quite useless. So i use chatterbot here .I trained the bot with the whatsapp chat exported from my whatsapp group i have with my closest homies . Trained with 39K lines of conservations (check whatsapp_skwad.py) , it is a bit arbitrary at times because its a bit unsorted . and i have yet to make more changes to it, but hey! "Tedha hain par mera hain "
hello_world.py: thats the telegram bot . it also runs commands like /bonk, /woof to generate a cheems photo and a dog photo respectively. no / before words invokes the chatbot .
